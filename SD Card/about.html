                <h3>This Website is powered by an ESP32. The ESP32 is a small microcontroller that can be coded by using
                    Arduino code, and has built in WiFi and Bluetooth.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>The ESP32 can also fetch data from any sort of sensors and other bits and bobs, including the CO2
                    sensor (A CCS811, which uses i2c, a simple communication protocol), and an SD card reader (which
                    uses SPI, another communication protocol, which is faster than I2C), which contains the website
                    files. This display also has a buzzer that is set off above the cautionary co2 threshold.</h3>
                <br>

                    case, and the components within it.</h3>
